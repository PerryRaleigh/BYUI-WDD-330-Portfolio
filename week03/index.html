  <h1>Week 03 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    I got the reading done and one of the exercises from the Eloquent JavaScript sandbox.
    I intended to get back to complete the remaining exercises but didn’t. I feel as though
    this week was about an 80% week as far as school work is concerned.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am employed as a software engineer and my employer is paying for several of the IBM
    engineers to attend a fourteen-week course that will train us as full stack web developers.
    It is a great opportunity and I feel that it is highly unusual for a corporation to do.
    The net result is that the past two weeks, I’ve been trained in almost everything this class will cover.
    So, I’ve completed a lot of JavaScript programming this week, just not directly related to this class.

    What I got done:

  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li><a href="index-START.html">Team meeting, need to look at the console to see the results</a></li>
    <li><a href="ejsBuildTable.html">Build a mountians table from Eloquent JavaScript sandbox.</a></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Questions:</h2>

    No Questions this week.
