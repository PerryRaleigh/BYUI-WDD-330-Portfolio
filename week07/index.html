  <h1>Week 07 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    This week was the opposite of last week, not so busy and everything went well.  
    Today was very busy though.  The team meeting was good and we got it all done.  
    Running late on time tonight so I will have to keep this brief.  The class is a real joy.  
    I am learning a lot and am able to do most of it on my own schedule.

  <h2>Questions:</h2>

    No questions this week.
