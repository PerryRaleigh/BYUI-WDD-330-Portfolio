  <h1>Week 05 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    Testing, in particular writing tests using a tool, is an area I need to 
    gain more experience.  However, the focus in this weekâ€™s reading on handling exceptions 
    was excellent and provided me with a better understanding of how to do this in 
    JavaScript.  Typically with JavaScript, it is written in a way that takes advantage 
    of the loosely typed nature of the language.  Coming from a background in IBM that 
    demands strongly typed variables and structures, I personally have never liked that about JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also like the direction the language is moving with regards to modules.  
    I feel this will make the language more robust and dynamic.  Code reusability will be more 
    formal now, rather than copy and paste.
  </p>
  <p>
    I did read the assignments, as well as the corresponding chapters in Eloquent JavaScript.  
    I find that I prefer Eloquent JavaScript to the Novice to Nija book.

    What I got done:
    <ul>
      <li>Competed the reading</li>
      <li><a href="./team-meeting05/index.html">Team meeting</a></li>
      <li><a href="../challenge1-todo-list/todoList.html">Started working on the Todo App challenge</a></li>
      <li>Reviewed and completed the solutions to the exercises in Eloquent JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
