  <h1>Week 01 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    I'm modelling this after the portfolio example weekly page, hope that is OK. This week was mostly busy work.
    <ol>
      <li>Downloading, installing, and learning VS Code.</li>
      <li>Setting up my portfolio.</li>
      <li>Figuring out how this course works.</li>
      <li>Plus, the reading and research.</li>
    </ol>
    In addition, I'm starting a new position at work which has me transitioning from IBMi technologies to Microsoft/AWS technologies. 
    So, there's been quite a lot of downloading and setting up things in my life this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    I did read all of the reading, including searching out the links provided in the assignment.  I enjoyed the 
    <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/master-mobile-ux-2952">Master Mobile UX</a> series. I think that will be 
    helpful in my new position at work.  I also setup and reviewed <a href="./story_editor.html">the story editor example</a> from the book. 
    I didn't have time to make changes or play with it, well except moving the scripts and CSS to external files. I did re-familiarize myself with how to use local storage.
  </p>
  <h2>Questions:</h2>
  <p>Only one question this week.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>If we should be designing for mobile first, shouldn't this course have a manual that leads us in that direction?</li>
    <ul><li>I think I'm off on the wrong path with this course already and am going to consider what I can do about this site to accomplish "mobile first".</li></ul>
  </ol>
