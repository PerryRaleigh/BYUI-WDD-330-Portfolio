  <h1>Week 02 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    This week was super busy at work, home, and with school. We got the stretch challenge completed, 
    with the exception of discussing call back functions. Nobody had completed the reading that far yet. 
    I did get a bit confused about the sandbox exercises until I realized the description of 
    what needed to be done was at the end of each chapter in Eloquent JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    I felt like there was a lot more reading this week, maybe it was just more complex 
    and that caused it to feel like more.  Hopefully I will always be able to complete it but I 
    spent much more time reading this week. I like the learning part, but I’m more of a learning by 
    doing kind of person.  Give me concise, but thorough, explanations, and I can then play with the code and learn from there.
  </p>
  <p>
    What I got done:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
    <li><a href="team02Week2First.html">Team meeting first part (actually steps 1 and 2)</a></li>
    <li><a href="team02Week2Second.html">Team meeting second part</a></li>
    <li><a href="team02Week2Stretch.html">Team meeting stretch challenge</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As I have been putting this report together, I realized I probably should have developed 
    some pages for the reading exercises, but I didn't.  None of them felt worthy of a separate page, 
    but I should have at least put them on a single page for your review.  I’ll be sure to do that in the future.
  </p>
  <h2>Questions:</h2>
  <p>
    I now understand call back functions better but still am not sure when to use them. I'll research more on this topic.
