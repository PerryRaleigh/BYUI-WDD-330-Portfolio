  <h1>Week 08 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    This week I did not get the reading done, only worked on the team assignment.  I feel like that went well,
     though I'm not a big fan of the formatting, but that is how thing go when 
     each member of the team is give a portion of the assignment to complete.  We 
     have found that the hour this week was not enough time to complete the assignment 
     so we divvied up the work and coordinated via Slack.  Got everything done that way.

    There is a curious issue with the code execution on GitHub.  It thinks we are using 
    an unsecured api url but I logged it to the console and it certainly has HTTPS at the 
    beginning.  However, the next and previous links that are provided by the api for paging 
    purposes does not use HTTPS.  Perhaps that is the issue, but I would expect the first 
    page to load properly.

    It works right from LiveServer in VS Code.
