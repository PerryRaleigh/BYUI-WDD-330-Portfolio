    I am so please with the built-in validation in HTML5.  
    It allows for relatively simple validation, thus freeing up the 
    JavaScript for application specific validation.  This basic 
    validation, combined with proper CSS can be very effective in 
    helping the user to respond to the web page appropriately.

    Fetch is one of my favorite aspects of JavaScript.  I tend 
    to use it differently from the examples in the reading, but it 
    still produces the same results.  I donâ€™t know what the best 
    practices are, but I find my code easier to read the way I do it.
  </p>
  <p>What I got done:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Competed the reading</li>
    <li><a href="./team-meeting/index.html">Attended the Team Meeting</a></li>
    <li>Continued working on the challenge project</li>
    <li>Reviewed and completed the solutions in the reading</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Questions:</h2>
  <p>
    The only question is related to your weekly announcement. 
    You said this was the "Last week of Team Work". There are Team 
    Activities for weeks 11 & 12, are these to be completed on my own?
