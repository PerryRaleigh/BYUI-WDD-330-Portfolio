  <h1>Week 06 Notes of WDD 330 - Web Frontend Development II</h1>
  <h2>Notes:</h2>
  <p>
    This week was an exhausting week for me.  I have piled way too much 
    on my plate and, as a consequence, I failed to get a complete solution 
    to challenge 1.  I felt like I was making good progress with it last 
    week, but this week I just didnâ€™t allow enough time to get the rest of it done.  
    I had an approach that was working fine without the local storage piece, 
    but it involved storing the list elements in an array which also stored the 
    classes associated with each element.  However, converting that to local 
    storage proved difficult.  I will have to rewrite much of my code to get 
    it working.  So, for now, I will have to turn in an incomplete assignment.
